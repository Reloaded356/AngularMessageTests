Additional Ideas for Implementation:

CSS classes to override and append where messages are used in order to indicate error, warning, etc (Green, yellow, red).
This will additionally trigger JS which would allow timing to be set on how long the modal/msg will stay active.
JS class design should be modular, vanilla JS, and locally accessible throughout the project.
